# Sample configuration for rpi_emulator_frontend
# Maps system folder names (top-level folders under your roms/ root) to emulator program and arguments.

# If true, systems that exist in the config but currently have no ROM files will still be shown
# in the UI. Default: false (hide empty systems).
show_empty_systems = false

# Default command used when a system does not have an explicit mapping (optional)
default = { program = "mgba-qt", args = ["{rom}"] }

# Optional: default roms path used when you don't pass a path on the command line.
# If set, the frontend will use this path when launching without arguments.
default_roms_path = "/mnt/emulators/Roms"

# Optional: font path to a TTF file. If set, the frontend will use this font instead of
# trying common system fonts or the FONT_PATH environment variable.

[systems]
# Game Boy Advance / Game Boy Color / Game Boy (system = folder name under roms/)
gba = { program = "mgba-qt", args = ["{rom}"], visible_extensions = ["gba", "GBA"] }
gb = { program = "mgba-qt", args = ["{rom}"], visible_extensions = ["gb"] }
ps2 = { program = "pcsx2", args = ["{rom} -fullscreen"], visible_extensions = ["chd", "iso", "bin"] }
psx = { program = "pcsx2", args = ["{rom}"], visible_extensions = ["chd", "bin", "iso"] }

# Example for overlapping extensions between systems (both may support .chd)
# You can explicitly list extensions associated with a system. When launching, the frontend
# prefers the system determined by folder; if no system mapping is found, it will try to
# locate a system that lists the file's extension. Order of systems in this file determines
# priority for extension-based resolution.
# ps1 = { program = "pcsx1", args = ["{rom}"], extensions = ["chd"] }
# ps2 = { program = "pcsx2", args = ["{rom}"], extensions = ["chd"] }

# To control which files are visible in the UI for a given system, you can provide
# `visible_extensions` for each system. If present, only files whose extension appears
# in this list will be shown under that system. If omitted, all files under the system
# folder are shown (except ignored archive extensions).
# Example:
# gba = { program = "mgba-qt", args = ["{rom}"], visible_extensions = ["gba","bin"] }

# Note: compressed archive files (zip/7z/rar) are ignored by the frontend. If you store ROMs
# inside archives, extract them first. Files directly in the roms/ root are ignored unless you
# create and configure a corresponding system for them.
